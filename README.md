## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

All of us is curious about the salary rate in different countries. By taking survey results of Stack Overflow performed in 2020 , I want to elaborate this issue. With this motivation, I am asking these questions: 
Which countries are more promosing in terms of salary?
2. Is the relationship between salary and satisfaction really linear? And how does it change according to region?
3. Do we need more degree to earn more money? 
4. Does a woman have same or similar opportunity in different countries?
5. Which countries are more promosing to earn more money based on our experience?
