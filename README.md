## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

All of us is curious about the salary rate in different countries. By taking survey results of Stack Overflow performed in 2020 , I want to elaborate this issue. With this motivation, I am asking these questions: </br>
1. Which countries are more promosing in terms of salary?</br>
2. Is the relationship between salary and satisfaction really linear? And how does it change according to region?</br>
3. Do we need more degree to earn more money? </br>
4. Does a woman have same or similar opportunity in different countries?</br>
5. Which countries are more promosing to earn more money based on our experience?</br>
